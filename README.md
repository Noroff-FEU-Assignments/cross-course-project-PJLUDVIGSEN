## Description

Rainydays, "An online shop selling men's and womenâ€™s rain jackets.
They are designed for a range of different outdoor activities that enriches people's lives."

Rainydays was the first project we were tasked with in our studies through Noroff, where we were to
implement different css and html functionality to complete our first website.
This is a school project where we were given a breif containing different criterias to be completed and contains:

- Home page
- List of Jackets
- A jacket specific page showing the jacket
- A checkout page
- A checkout success page
- About page
- Contact page

This was all to be completed with design features, resposiveness and accessibility in mind.
Later in the course we were also tasked with implementing different Javascript functionality.
